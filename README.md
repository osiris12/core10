# Core10 Star Wars API Exercise

This small Laravel app is my solution to the following code exercise:

## Requirements

1. Build a REST API to connect to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/documentation#intro)

2. Include a readme on how to interact with the API

3. Include tests

## Endpoints to build

1. Return a list of the Starships related to Luke Skywalker

2. Return the classification of all species in the 1st episode

3. Return the total population of all planets in the Galaxy


# How to use
This is a small Laravel application. I used Laravel's Homestead environment to develop locally using PHP 8.1 and Laravel 9.50.1.

The setup for this app is like any other plain laravel application. 

The [api documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/960715/2s935mr4wZ) was created with Postman.

I have also deployed a [demo application](https://phplaravel-480752-3242112.cloudwaysapps.com/) that is hosted on Cloudways.

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  php artisan test
```
Note: The app url will have to be properly configured for the tests to pass.
